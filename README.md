Liked the posts by https://www.facebook.com/tamilnaduweatherman/ and each time I had to wait a long time to get recent updates on the weather.

On checking the pics which are posted by Tamilnaduweatherman I observed them to be from Indian Meteorological Department but there were no noticable/searchable links to the radar data on the site, so I wrote a quick hack that generates the recent url and downloads the radar images.

P.S:
  1) Not sure if the image from the website is distributable. I see a valid problem solving by pushing it to any social network or a whatsapp group so holding this part to check the licenses.
  2) http://www.imd.gov.in/ seems to be path traversable site and that looks to a known vulnerability.
